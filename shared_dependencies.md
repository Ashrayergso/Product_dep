1. **Data Schemas**: The product schema is shared across multiple files. It includes fields such as product name, description, product number, vendor name, cost, product image, and link to a product site.

2. **Function Names**: Functions for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and export functionalities are shared across the backend files. These include functions like `create_product()`, `read_product()`, `update_product()`, `delete_product()`, and `export_product_list()`.

3. **CSS Classes and IDs**: The CSS file `styles.css` will contain classes and IDs that are used in the `index.html` file for styling the product element cards and other components. These could include classes like `.product-card`, `.product-image`, `.product-description`, etc., and IDs like `#product-name`, `#product-number`, `#vendor-name`, etc.

4. **Python Libraries**: Python libraries such as Streamlit for the front-end and any libraries used for the back-end operations are shared across the `streamlit_app.py`, `database.py`, `product.py`, `product_controller.py`, and `search.py` files.

5. **Deployment Dependencies**: The `deploy.py` and `requirements.txt` files share the dependencies required for the application to run. These include the Python version, required libraries, and any other dependencies.

6. **Documentation**: The `user_manual.md` file will contain instructions on how to use the application, which will be based on the functionalities implemented in the other files.

7. **Search Functionality**: The `search.py` utility is used in the `product_controller.py` for the feature to look for product alternatives online. 

8. **Database Connection**: The `database.py` file will establish a connection to the database, which will be used in the `product.py` and `product_controller.py` files for performing the CRUD operations.
